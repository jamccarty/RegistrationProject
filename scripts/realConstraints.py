    numTimeSlots -- number of time slots (integer)
    rooms -- array of Room() objects - 
        Each Room() object in rooms holds the following pieces of information:
            capacity - the capacity of the room, integer
            id - the id of the room, string
    numClasses -- number of classes (integer)

            id = the id of the time
            start_time  - the start time, float
            end_time - the end time, float
